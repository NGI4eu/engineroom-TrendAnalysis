# Trend Analysis

We have made a trend analysis, using a time series algorithm called Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
We can find the articles of the Wikipedia which has more similar sequences in pageviews (normalized, so that it's not taking into account the total number of pageviews, but the tren), which may vary in speed (in the different months).
